What would you do if you woke up tomorrow with a tax-free _billion dollars_ in the bank? Here's what
I would do...

<!--more-->

I'm sure I'm not alone in having daydreamed extensively on the topic of "What would I do if I had
real 'F- You' money?"

There are, of course, the gimmes:

- Pay off all debts for my immediate and extended family,
- Set up reasonable trust funds for the wife and kids so they never have to worry about where
  they're going to sleep or what they're going to eat that day,
- Buy myself "something nice" and travel the world...

...but we're talking a full-on **billion dollars** here; the three bullets above aren't going to
make the _tiniest dent_ in that kind of money; so, what are you going to _do_ with it? Well, here's
my fantasy.

## Step 1 - The Money

The first thing I'd do is create and fund a non-profit corporation to buy up all the ugly, rundown,
leaky rental properties in my old neighborhood (which is practically all of them). I'd drop some
cash on them to fix them up, make them places people _want_ to live, rather than places people end
up. Then I'd rent them back out on a sliding income scale, prioritizing low-income and
"low-but-not-quite-low-enough-for-government-assistance-income" renters, **because you shouldn't
have to be rich to have a decent place to live.**

## Step 2 - The Sink

Now, the cool part: I'd start a private preK-12 STEM & Trades school, funded by a trust and the
rental income collected by the non-profit. Tuition would be sliding scale, with guaranteed
acceptance of any child living in one of my non-profit's properties.

The school would pay good wages—the kind that allowed single income families to own a home, a car,
and send their kids to college through the 50s and 60s—to attract top-notch educators and staff,
offer free breakfast & lunch comprised of _actual food_ (entirely unlike the square blocks of
"pizza" and boxes of watery milk with which my generation grew up), and quality after-school
programs that run late enough to accomodate working parents.

PreK through maybe 6th grade would be a Montessori-esque system, where children are exposed to as
many disciplines as possible and allowed to largely follow their own interests while maintaining a
reasonable level of literacy in reading, writing, and mathematics.

7th through 9th grades would be the "funnel years" where students, supported by dedicated and
credentialed counsellors, start to build toward a focus on either the STEM or Trades track.

10th through 12th grades are where the magic happens:

- On the Trades track, kids would learn from actual Master Tradespeople with the intention of
  completing a Trades School curriculum and getting a leg up on (or even completing) their
  apprenticeship in given trade;
- On the STEM track, the focus would be to build real world skills in their chosen discipline while
  prepping students for a 4 year degree program with some credits (or even an Associate's Degree)
  already in their pocket.
  - Note: Not entirely sure how I'd implement it, but I really want the STEM track to be heavily
    research-oriented; i.e., students would not just read, analyze, and report on current research,
    but (where feasible) _replicate_ it.

## Step 3 - Repeat

Armchair math suggests I could do this for somewhere between 125-175 million dollars. Let's say I
keep a healthy $50 million in a trust to support my extended family and use the rest of the billion
to buy up neighborhoods and start schools; conservatively, I could fund 5 of these projects and
still have tens of millions left over. Without fundraising a dime, without a single tax break,
paying top dollar per sq ft, and (most importantly) **without displacing a single low-income
community member**, I could completely transform **at least** 5 crappy neighborhoods into good
communities with a high quality preK-12 school to support it. I could just...do it.

## Conclusion
