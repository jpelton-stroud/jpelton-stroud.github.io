Joshua Pelton-Stroud is an Elder Millenial, Data Analyst, Programmer, Husband & Father of Three.
Joshua does **not** enjoy long walks on the beach; instead, he prefers to spend his time coding pet projects
(like the [Legislative Tracker](https://github.com/legislative-tracker/reimagined-parakeet#readme-ov-file)),
or playing video & table top games with whichever family members he's able to rope into it.
